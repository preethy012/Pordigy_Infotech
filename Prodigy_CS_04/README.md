This is a basic keylogger made with Python.

It records the keys you type and saves them to a file called key_log.txt.

Only run this on your own computer or with permission.
Do NOT use this on someone else's device without their knowledge.
Using keyloggers without permission is illegal and wrong.

3.It will ask you to agree to the rules. Type 'yes' to continue.
4.Press ESC to stop the program.
5.Check the file key_log.txt to see the keys you typed.
