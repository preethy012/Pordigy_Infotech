Task 3

Password Strength Checker â€” Summary
This project is a command-line tool that helps users create strong and secure passwords. It checks whether a password is good enough by looking at five key things:

Is it long enough? (At least 8 characters)

Does it have uppercase letters? (Like A, B, C)

Does it have lowercase letters? (Like a, b, c)

Does it have numbers? (Like 1, 2, 3)

Does it include special characters? (Like @, #, $, !)

If a password is missing any of these things, the program gives clear feedback on how to improve it.

The best part? It keeps asking the user to try again until they enter a very strong password that meets all the security rules. Once they do, it congratulates them and ends.

 Why it's useful:
This tool is a great way to:

Help users understand what makes a strong password.

Prevent weak passwords that could be guessed or hacked.

Teach basic security awareness in a fun and interactive way.
